# Reducing-Financial-burden-on-elderly-patients
Reducing the financial burden on the elderly by tackling allergic conditions. A case study of the Maryland Department of Health.
Allergy reactions are the most common immunological diseases and represent the most widespread and growing chronic human problems among people 15 years and older in developed countries. Allergies have a heightened risk of heart problems (Bergmann, K., & Sypniewska, 2011). As populations get older worldwide, allergy manifestations in aged persons will occur more often in the future. 
Maryland state, and specifically Baltimore City, currently struggles with allergies. According to the Maryland Department of Health, 13.7% of Baltimore City adults currently have asthma, compared to 9.0% statewide and 9.0% nationally. Baltimore City's rate of emergency department visits due to asthma is the highest in Maryland (City of Baltimore, 2022). 

The purpose of this project is to propose some level of assistance in the healthcare needs of the older population in Baltimore by addressing the issue of allergic conditions.

## Conclusion/Suggestions
Decreasing total pollen in the air and controlling the abundance of more allergic pollen such as ragweed pollen can be accomplished by excluding undesirable pollen producers in newly built communities or in established neighborhoods.
Stricter home inspections could be a solution to the mold issue.
Healthcare costs for allergic conditions are $432549.21 (a fraction of healthcare costs). Free allergic screening/treatment for all patients, bearing in mind that these allergies could lead to other life-threatening conditions; thus more healthcare burden on the elderly.
